## Public speaking

While this started out as a personal project so that I could learning from others, the experiences that I have had so far have made me realize the impact of sharing my experiences & knowledge with the community.

I am truly grateful for the opportunities I have been given to share knowledge about the things I've worked on/am working on. 

Here's the [GitHub link](https://github.com/divya-mohan0209/talks) with the presentations & video links updated of talks I have delivered so far.

While I'm happy to speak at your event, I want to ensure I'm using the platform I'm being given conscientiously. Therefore, I'd request you to read the [Speaker Rider](https://github.com/divya-mohan0209/talks/blob/main/speaker-rider.md) before reaching out!
