A self-confessed bookworm with a voracious appetite for tinkering, I am forever on the lookout for new things to learn. A recently inducted FOSS enthusiast, I am happy to serve Kubernetes, LitmusChaos, & Ortelius in reconciling the documentation, policies, & strategies to keep up with the ever-evolving nature of these projects. Technical documentation is a cause I'm passionate about. As a part of this year's Google Season of Docs, I'm working with CERN-HSF to restructure & modernize the documentation for Rucio, the data management system powering the ATLAS & CMS experiments on the LHC.
