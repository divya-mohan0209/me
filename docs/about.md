## The short of it...

Hiya there! My name is Divya & I'm a Senior Systems Administrator at HSBC. I am a frequent contributor to several Open source projects, in addition to which I enjoy reading books & playing with my cat. 

## The long form...

Hello! As you already probably know, my name is Divya Mohan. Before my current stint with HSBC as a Senior Systems Administrator, I've worked with IGATE Global Solutions (now [Capgemini](https://www.capgemini.com/in-en/)), freelanced with [DNA](https://www.dnaindia.com/authors/divya-mohan) covering the general elections in India during the summer of 2014, & was into social media management with [Experience Commerce](https://www.experiencecommerce.com/). I've also interned with Godrej during the final year of my Engineering and tweaked an electronic locking system using the iButton.

One cause that I'm very passionate about is great technical documentation (because we have so few of that, rightttt?) and serve various Open source projects in the below capacities:

- Kubernetes (1.19 & 1.20 Release Shadow, k8s storyteller)
- Ortelius (Marketing & Outreach team)
- LitmusChaos (SIG DOCS lead)

As part of the Google Season of Docs this year, I am also working with **CERN-HSF** to better documentation for their Data Management System, [**Rucio**](http://rucio.cern.ch/). In my spare time, I love reading, writing, and co-parenting a cat who's almost as curious as I am. I'm always learning something new & tinkering with things (often leading to mishaps like broken keyboards & laptops that refuse to switch on) & am happy to [chat](https://calendly.com/divya-mohan0209) about it.

I love helping people learn from my mistakes, so I'd be more than happy to speak at your event. You can find more details about that on my [Projects page](projects). Feel free to [email me](mailto:divya.mohan0209@gmail.com).
